# uTikDownloadHelper

## Whats new
I updated the code for the wii u title ticket website. I may change how it looks after i get done with school. 

## About
This utility is meant to simplify patching a Wii U .tik file and downloading the title data using NUSgrabber.

## Usage
The application can either be run by double-clicking the exe or by opening a tik file with it.

If you know what the web address of the Wii U ticket database website is you can also enable a list view that easily enabled you to download the tickets.

After you choose a ticket the application will then ask you for a folder to save the output files to.

When that is finished you can copy the files from that folder to your SD card install folder without any additional work required.

## Disclaimer
I am not liable for whatever you choose to do with this program. It's only made to make reacquiring owned games easier. In the end it's your personal choice to use this software.
